# Algorithm Implementation

In this repository, I post notebook and scripts of algorithm that I have implemented from scratch. Algorithms implemented are in the realm of statistics, optimization and CS. Programming languages used are R or Python. The steps to install the R kernel notebook can be found here http://irkernel.github.io/

List of Notebook
- Batch vs Stochastic Gradient Descent
- KNN
- Longuest Binary Gap Computation (inspired by Twitter challenge)
- Decimal to Binary conversion
