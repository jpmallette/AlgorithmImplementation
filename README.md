# Algorithm Implementation

In this repository, I post notebook and scripts of data science algorithm implemented from scratch. I also solve programming challenges. Programming languages used are R or Python. The step to install the R kernel for the notebook can be found here http://irkernel.github.io/

List of Notebook
- Batch vs Stochastic Gradient Descent
- KNN
- Longest Binary Gap Challenge
